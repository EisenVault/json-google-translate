This project can be used to translate strings in a JSON object using Google Translate.
See test-en.json for a sample input file and test-ar.json for a sample output file.

In the code, you need to change the global variables for target language, source file and target file as per your requirement.
I have tested this with translating from English to Spanish and Arabic.


To use this project, please install Node.js, Python 3 and Google Cloud Command Line tools

To run, use the below on commandline
`node index.js`
